title: Data carpentry -- Starting with R for data analysis
keywords: ["R", "subset", "data.frame", "read.csv"]
---

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data.frame, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.

(This particular set of lessons was originally revised by [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org) for a
[Data Carpentry workshop](http://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2016-06-01-uwmadison/) at UW-Madison on 1-2 June 2016.)

The current version was revised by [Laura Saba](https://www.thesabalab.com/) for an introductory lecture in TXCL7565 at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus on December 1, 2020.
